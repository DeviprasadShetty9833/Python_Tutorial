<br> ▶️ Indentation is used to define blocks of code.
<br> ▶️ All statements with the same level of indentation are considered part of the same block.
<br> ▶️ Indentation is achieved using whitespace (spaces or tabs) at the beginning of each line.
<br> <br>

*Code:*
```html
if 10 > 5:
    print("I have indentation.")

print("I have no indentation.")
```
> - The 1st print statement is indented by 4 spaces, so they belong to the if block.
> - The 2nd print statement is not indented, so it is outside the if block.
