<br> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Indentation is used to define blocks of code.
<br> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è All statements with the same level of indentation are considered part of the same block.
<br> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Indentation is achieved using whitespace (spaces or tabs) at the beginning of each line.

*Code:*
```python
if 10 > 5:
    print("I have indentation.")

print("I have no indentation.")
```
> - The 1st print statement is indented by 4 spaces, so they belong to the if block.
> - The 2nd print statement is not indented, so it is outside the if block.

# Data Types

<br> ![1.](https://img.shields.io/badge/_1._-Numeric-34A853?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)

1.1 Integer

*Code:*
```python
x = int(1)
print(x)
print(type(x))
```

*Output:*
```html
1
<class 'int'>
```

1.2 Float 

*Code:*
```python
y = float(2)
print(y)
print(type(y))
```

*Output:*
```html
2.0
<class 'float'>
```

1.3 Complex

*Code:*
```python
z = complex(1, 2)
print(z)
print(type(z))
```

*Output:*
```html
1 + 2j
<class 'complex'>
```

<br> ![2.](https://img.shields.io/badge/_2._-Dictionary-34A853?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)

*Code:*
```python
d1 = {1 : 'Geeks', 2 : 'For', 3 : 'Geeks'}
print(d1)
```

*Output:*
```html
{1 : 'Geeks', 2 : 'For', 3 : 'Geeks'}
```

- Using dict()

*Code:*
```python
d2 = dict(a = "Geeks", b = "For", c = 'Geeks')  # String keys only
print(d2)
```

*Output:*
```html
{'a' : 'Geeks', 'b' : 'For', 'c' : 'Geeks'}
```

- Using dict() & zip()

*Code:*
```python
keys = [1, 2, 3]
values = ['Geeks', 'For', 'Geeks']
d3 = dict(zip(keys, values))
print(d3)
d3 = dict(zip(values, keys))  # Dictionaries are mutable
print(d3)

```

*Output:*
```html
{1 : 'Geeks', 2 : 'For', 3 : 'Geeks'}
{'Geeks' : 3, 'For' : 2}
```
> -  Initially, 1 is assigned to 'Geeks' then 1 is replaced and 3 is assigned to 'Geeks'.

*Code:*
```python
d4 = {'GEEKS' : 1, 'For' : 2, 'Geeks' : 3}  # Case sensitive 
print(d4)
```

*Output:*
```html
{'GEEKS' : 1, 'For' : 2, 'Geeks' : 3}
```

- Storing different values

*Code:*
```python
d5 = {'name' : 'Deva', 'age' : 19}
print(d5)
```

*Output:*
```html
{'name' : 'Deva', 'age' : 19}
```

- Storing different keys

*Code:*
```python
d6 = {"name" : 'Deva', 15 : "age"}
print(d6)
```

*Output:*
```html
{'name' : 'Deva', 15 : 'age'}
```

3. Boolean
4. Set

# Oops Concept 

<br> ![1.](https://img.shields.io/badge/_1._-Classes_&_Objects-34A853?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)   

# RegEx

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Regular Expressions (RegEx) are a powerful tool for **pattern matching** and **text manipulation** that allows you to search, extract, replace, or validate strings based on specific patterns.

**(A) `re.search()`**
- Checks if a pattern exists in a string.
- Returns the **first match** (or `None`).

*Code:*
```python
text = "Python is fun"
match = re.search(r"fun", text)
if match:
    print("Found:", match.group())  
```

*Output:*
```html
Found: fun
```

*Code:*
```python
import re
regex = r"([a-zA-Z]+) (\d+)"

match = re.search(regex, "I was born on June 2")
if match != None:
    print ("Match at index %s, %s" % (match.start(), match.end()))
    print ("Full match: %s" % (match.group(0)))
    print ("Month: %s" % (match.group(1)))
    print ("Day: %s" % (match.group(2)))

else:
    print ("The regex pattern does not match.")
```

*Output:*
```html
Match at index 14, 20
Full match: June 2
Month: June
Day: 2
```

*Explanation:*
- r"..." : Raw string to avoid escaping backslashes (i.e., \n stays as \n).
- ([a-zA-Z]+) : Match one or more letters (uppercase or lowercase). i.e., the month name.
- (\d+) : Match one or more digits i.e., the day number.
- The space '  ' between them : Expect a space between the two parts.
- match.start(), match.end() : Starting & Ending index of match in the string.
- match.group(0) : entire matched string.
- match.group(1) : 1st group of matched string.
- match.group(2) : 2nd group of matched string.

 **(B) `re.findall()`**
- Returns **all matches** as a list.

*Code:*
```python
text = "cats and dogs"
matches = re.findall(r"[a-z]+", text)
print(matches)  # Output: ['cats', 'and', 'dogs']
```

 **(C) `re.sub()`**
- Replaces matches with new text.

*Code:*
```python
text = "Python is awesome"
new_text = re.sub(r"awesome", "great", text)
print(new_text)  # Output: "Python is great"
```

 **(D) `re.split()`**
- Splits a string by a pattern.

*Code:*
```python
text = "apple,banana,cherry"
items = re.split(r",", text)
print(items)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```
